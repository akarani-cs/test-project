3. installed tailwind
started on components 
started on routing and state management
linked to apis
pushed to prod


this project uses react, tailwindcss.
the api used is the OMDB apiand TMDB


the endpoints are in the reviews component
the trailers component 
the quotes component
the ratings component 

the movies i can watch forever pulls from the OMDB api, the other endpoints pull from the TMDB api


routing has been done using react router dom (client side)
i implemented transitions using framer-motion

the search bar was quitedifficult to implement without crashing other features, i intended to search through the catalogue from theAPI
